# 📱 React Bottom Sheet with Snap Points and Spring Motion
A beautiful, responsive Bottom Sheet built with **React** and **vanilla CSS/JS animation**, featuring smooth **spring motion** and multiple snap points — all without using animation libraries like `framer-motion` or `react-spring-bottom-sheet`.
## 🚀 Features
- 🎯 Multiple snap points: **Closed**, **Half-open**, and **Fully open**
- 🧼 Smooth spring animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- 🎨 Clean, minimal, and responsive design
- 🖱️ Drag-and-drop gesture support
- 🔘 Header buttons for direct snap control
- 📱 Mobile-friendly

## 🛠️ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishnuBhai16/React-Bottom-Sheet.git
cd React-Bottom-Sheet

Full OPEN:

💡 How It Works
The spring effect is implemented manually using:

requestAnimationFrame

Dynamic velocity & tension simulation

Manual drag gesture calculations (no 3rd-party drag libraries)

✨ Customization Ideas
Add dark/light mode toggle

Add keyboard accessibility

Add snapping with mouse wheel

Add unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library
